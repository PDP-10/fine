FINE (FINE Is Not EMACS) text editor for TOPS-10, written by Mike
Kazar at C-MU in BLISS-10 in the early 1980's.

Mike recently gave me permission to distribute FINE sources.

My observations;

How hard it was to get anything done in those days.  Even Barb admits
it was easier to write user programs on TOPS-20!  I only attempted a
few personal projects on TOPS-10 after getting to DEC and having a
choice.  But it was a tough row to hoe, I was always writing daemons
of one sort or another, but the guardians of KL1026 saw anything
running in user mode as a waste of cycles (Alan and I were clearly
third class citizens*, working on the FORTRAN-10/20 compiler (despite
the fact that it was probably the piece of DEC S/W that people bought
systems to run (The best BASIC comming from U Penn Medical School).

Second class citizenship was probably CUSP maintainers -- tools
(MACRO and LINK) used by real men to make real code (the monitor).

How much time we all spent reformatting code.

How amazing that we lived without using source control!

What an angry young man I was!  The comments are well, positively
nasty at times!  And I don't think I saw any about Alan's bosses at
the Stevens Computer Center, who were working on TECO (what ended up
as TECO v200) -- I remember they stole FINE sources (mounted a private
pack to read the code) to figure out how it figured out how to do
screen updates using line insert/delete.  Then they did a one-up, and
used the same algorithms for character insert/delete as well (all
coded in MACRO, as real men were wont to). The screen updates were
enough to give you montion sickness, I remember GNU EMACS had a
similar effect on me when I first used it on slow lines...

It seems we were all working on editors -- my freshman year roomate
Rich Braun had wrote his own from scratch....
